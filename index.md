## About

I specialize in **taking products from scrappy startup to scaled business**—proven at Intuit (QuickBooks Live 0→1), Faire (high-growth chaos), and Adobe (mature at scale).

My foundation: traditional PM training with deep strategy playbooks (opportunity assessment, customer problem breakdown, prioritization), discovery chops (surveys, follow-me-homes), and PM org building (competencies, interviews, structure).

I've built self-serve SMB products at world-class companies (Intuit, Adobe, Faire) and currently run a **$360M global enterprise product** at Adobe serving Enterprise ($200M) and Mid-Market/SMB ($150M).

**Sweet spot:** Scale-up companies looking to professionalize, companies in the Middle East seeking best practices.
