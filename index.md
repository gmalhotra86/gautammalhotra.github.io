  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>I specialize in taking products from scrappy startup to scaled business—proven at Intuit (QuickBooks Live 0→1), Faire (high-growth chaos), and Adobe (mature at scale).</p>
  
  <p>My foundation: traditional PM training with deep strategy playbooks (opportunity assessment, customer problem breakdown, prioritization), discovery chops (surveys, follow-me-homes), and PM org building (competencies, interviews, structure).</p>
  
  <p>I've built self-serve SMB products at world-class companies (Intuit, Adobe, Faire) and currently run Acrobat Sign, Adobe's e-signature business.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Sweet spot:</strong> Scale-up companies looking to professionalize</p>
